					<p class="secondary_intro">Farm workers are essential to America’s critical food infrastructure.
						Despite
						abundant and fertile land, our food supply of fresh fruit and vegetables relies increasingly on
						imported produce as labor shortages in the crop production industry persist. To shed more light
						on
						this worrying trend, we analyzed data from the United States Department of Agriculture and
						American
						Community Survey on the U.S.’ fruit and vegetable supply, on the workers who harvest these
						crops,
						and the trends affecting America’s agriculture industry over the past decade. We find that
						immigrants play a crucial role in our nation’s food supply chain, and they will continue to do
						so as
						essential workers harvesting America’s fruits and vegetables. </p><br>

						<div class='step1' data-step='1'>
							<p>Generally, the overall availability and market for fruits and vegetables has increased
								for
								the past three decades. Most of this increase is due to population growth and increased
								consumer demand for fresh produce. In fact, over the past two decades, rather than
								increasing the home grown supply of fruit and vegetables, the U.S. has increasingly
								relied
								on imported produce to meet consumers’ demands.</p>
						</div>
						<div class='step1' data-step='2'>
							<h3>The share of imported fresh fruit sold in the United States has more than doubled</h3>
							<p>Nearly 43%, or 12.5 billion lbs, of the United States’ fresh fruit supply, excluding
								bananas,
								which have always been nearly all grown abroad, was imported in 2019. That’s more than
								twice
								the share of fresh fruit that was imported in 2000, when only 20.1% was imported. Today,
								in
								addition to bananas, some fruits are now almost all completely imported. For instance,
								less
								than one percent of pineapples, ten percent of avocados, and thirty percent of
								raspberries
								are grown in the U.S. Increased dependence on imported fruits and vegetables not only
								decreases American food security, but it also has an economic cost.</p>
						</div>
						<div class='step1' data-step='3'>
							<h3>Vegetable imports have also increased significantly</h3>
							<p>Similar to our fruit supply, over 31% of the fresh vegetables consumed in the United
								States
								in 2019 were imported (16 billion lbs). This is 50% higher than the share of vegetables
								that
								were imported into the United States in 2000. Today, six in ten tomatoes and 99% of
								asparagus come from outside the United States.</p>

						<div class='step2 hideMe' data-step='0'>
							<p></p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='1'>
							<h3>As vegetable and fruit imports increase, the amount of U.S. land dedicated to farming
								fruits
								and vegetables has shrunk.</h3>
							<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/">USDA Farm Census</a>, over
								7.5
								million acres were used to harvest fresh fruits and vegetables, excluding potatoes in
								2002.
								Over 56% were devoted to vegetables.</p>
						</div>
						<div class='step2' data-step='2'>
							<p>By 2017, farmland used for fruit and vegetables declined by 6.7%. The biggest decrease
								was in
								the citrus industry, which saw a 17% drop in acres farmed.</p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='3'>
							<h3>Fruit and vegetable crop production has high labor costs.</h3>
							<p>Compared to other parts of the agriculture industry, fruit and vegetable production is
								burdened by with high labor costs. For most farms, labor costs are equal to <a
									href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/"> approximately 10%
									of
									total farm income</a>. For fruit farms, the share of the labor cost is nearly three
								times higher (27.7%), and vegetable production is over two times higher (23.1%).</p>
						</div>


						<div class='step2' data-step='4'>
							<p>On top of this, high labor costs have continued to rise and are <a
									href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/"> expected to
									rise</a>
								even more due to an aging crop production workforce and a decline in younger workers
								interested in working in fruit and vegetable harvesting.</p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='5'>
							<h3>Wages for crop workers have far outpaced even those for college graduates.</h3>
							<p>Although the overall number of farm workers in the U.S. has stabilized, rapid wage growth
								among crop workers suggests that there are still not enough farm workers to meet demand.
								To
								determine the size of labor costs and the crop worker shortage, we took average wage
								growth
								for crop workers from <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/">USDA survey data</a>
								and
								salary data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html">the U.S.
									Census Current Population Survey</a> from 2005 to 2020.During this time, crop worker
								wages grew faster than the wage growth of high school graduates and college graduates.
								Wages
								for crop workers even outstripped college graduates in the top 10 percent of earners, a
								group whose skills were in particularly high demand during this time.</p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='6'>
							<h3>In 2019, almost 57 percent of crop production workers were immigrants.</h3>
							<p>Despite difficulties estimating the number of immigrant crop workers due to the seasonal
								nature of farm work, using data from the American Community Survey, we estimate that the
								share of workers that were foreign-born has decreased slightly since 2014, which was
								61.4%.
								This decrease is consistent with other data sources that have shown <a
									href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/">a decrease in
									migrant
									farm workers and younger farm workers</a>, likely due to a decrease in the
								undocumented
								population in the United States.</p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='7'>
							<p>Today, undocumented immigrants make up nearly 31% of crop production workers. Given the
								trends just discussed, the number of undocumented has also been been decreasing for the
								past
								few years.</p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='8'>
							<h3>America’s immigrant farm workers</h3>
							<p>The current agriculture labor shortage is exacerbated by the fact that younger immigrants
								are
								not taking on crop production jobs. This has caused the average age of the farm worker
								labor
								force to increase. Since 2006, the average age of immigrant crop workers rose by 6
								years.
								Today, the average age among foreign-born agricultural workers is 41.6 years old.
								Meanwhile,
								the average age of their U.S. born counterparts is 36.7. In addition to the economic
								impacts
								of an aging workforce, there are many health implications for these essential workers
								who
								face risks from <a
									href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-agricultural-workers.html">COVID
									infection</a> and <a
									href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/us/heat-wave-deaths.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/us/heat-wave-deaths.html">heat
									stress</a> from rising temperatures due to climate change. </p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='9'>
							<h3>The number of temporary farm worker visas has nearly tripled in ten years.</h3>
							<p>The H2-A visa program was created to help agricultural employers hire seasonal workers to
								grow and harvest their crops. The program limits visa holders to 10 months to work in
								the
								U.S. for an authorized employer. Although the number of undocumented crop workers has
								decreased the past few years, according to the <a
									href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance">U.S. Department of
									Labor</a>, the number of H2-A farm workers has nearly tripled since 2010.</p>
						</div>

						<div class='step2' data-step='10'>
							<p>The states to see the largest increases were Florida, California, Georgia, Washington,
								and
								Michigan, which were all at least 5 times higher than their 2010 count. The fresh
								produce
								most specified in H2-A visa applications were all fruits that need gentle handling:
								apples,
								blueberries, and strawberries.</p>
